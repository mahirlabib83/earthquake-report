# 🌏 Bangladesh Multizone Earthquake Monte Carlo Simulation

A Python-based Monte Carlo simulation to estimate **50-year maximum earthquake magnitudes** and exceedance probabilities across multiple seismic zones in Bangladesh.  
This project leverages the **Gutenberg-Richter law** and **Poisson statistics** to model earthquake occurrence.

## ⚡ Features

- **🌐 Multizone modeling:** Simulates earthquakes in four key zones—Dauki, Madhupur, Chittagong, and Megathrust.  
- **🎲 Monte Carlo simulation:** Runs 20,000 trials to capture statistical variability.  
- **📏 Gutenberg-Richter magnitude sampling:** Generates magnitudes from a truncated exponential distribution.  
- **📊 Probability exceedances:** Computes likelihood of earthquakes exceeding thresholds (M ≥ 6.0, 7.0, 8.0).  
- **🖼️ Visualization:** Plots histogram of maximum magnitudes over a 50-year window.
